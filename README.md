# test-repo
Team work exercise

Work into teams of (about) 5 students in class:

- Online students work alone or form their teams.

- Each team selects a "team leader".

- The team leader creates a repository in GitHub, e.g., "test-repo".

- The team leader invites his team to the repo



Add a File to GitHub

Team members add a few files:

- Clone the "test-repo" into your computer (if not cloned yet).

- Create a new file into your working directory:

	· Name the new file "<your_name>.txt".

	· Put some text in it the file, e.g., "My name is …".

- Commit the new file to your local repository.

- Sync the changes to upload your file to the remote repo.

- Browse the repo from https://github.com/user/repo to check whether your file has been successfully uploaded to GitHub.


Create a Git Conflict & Merge

- All team members create a common file, "config.txt".

- Each team member adds some settings in "config.txt", e.g.:

	- name = Peter

	- size = 100

	- email = peter@dir.bg

- Each team member commits his local changes.

- Each team member syncs his changes.

- The first member will succeed without conflicts.

- The others will have a conflict to be merged.

- Resolve the conflict:

	- Edit the merged changes + commit and sync again
