1. GitHub Profile Link

Create a new text document called "1. GitHub Link.txt", and put a link to your GitHub profile inside it. The file should look something like this:



2. GitHub Repository Screenshot
Take a screenshot of your GitHub repository using something like a snipping tool, then save the file as "2. GitHub Repo.jpg".



3. Meet Some Colleagues

First and foremost, look around your colleagues and try to make acquaintances with your fellow students. After you meet someone, note down the following information about them in a text document:

· What is their name?

· Where are they from?

· What hobbies/pastimes do they enjoy?

· Why did they pick SoftUni?

Try to do this with at least 3 students and also exchange contact information with them.

Hopefully, you made a couple of new friends from this exercise



4. Upload Homework to SoftUni

Put all of the text files and screenshots you created in a zip file and send it as homework on the SoftUni site



5. Teamwork

Work into teams of (about) 5 students in class:

- Online students work alone or form their teams.

- Each team selects a "team leader".

- The team leader creates a repository in GitHub, e.g., "test-repo".

- The team leader invites his team to the repo



6. Add a File to GitHub

Team members add a few files:

- Clone the "test-repo" into your computer (if not cloned yet).

- Create a new file into your working directory:

	· Name the new file "<your_name>.txt".

	· Put some text in it the file, e.g., "My name is …".

- Commit the new file to your local repository.

- Sync the changes to upload your file to the remote repo.

- Browse the repo from https://github.com/user/repo to check whether your file has been successfully uploaded to GitHub.


7. Create a Git Conflict & Merge

- All team members create a common file, "config.txt".

- Each team member adds some settings in "config.txt", e.g.:

	- name = Peter

	- size = 100

	- email = peter@dir.bg

- Each team member commits his local changes.

- Each team member syncs his changes.

- The first member will succeed without conflicts.

- The others will have a conflict to be merged.

- Resolve the conflict:

	- Edit the merged changes + commit and sync again
